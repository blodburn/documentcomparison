# DOCUMENTCOMPARE — verified C# to Rust document-engine scope (2026-10-22)

## Decision: do not replace the complete document engine

The original policy in UNIFIED_VERSION_CODE_RUST_REVIEW_2026-10-20.md
requires exact golden-output equivalence, source-location parity, no
regressions in A/B/C matching or Word/Excel exports, and separate performance
and packaging checks BEFORE replacing C# document judgment.

MainWindow and VersionHistoryControl still use NativeComparisonEngine
for the Word/TXT document pipeline. That includes article/unit lineage,
paragraph/item matching, table/row/cell pairing, text diff, marker rendering,
and Word/Excel export. None of those complete functions has been migrated
to Rust or proven semantically equivalent. NativeDocumentReader,
StructuredDocxReader, and NativeOfficeExporter remain C#.
The original Python comparison engine is not currently present as a
testable independent source in this repository; Python-equivalence claims
must not be inferred merely from matching current C# behavior.

## Current rollout gates

| Rule | Reference | Rust engine | Gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Source-code LF/CRLF bounded LCS | CodeVersionComparer | diff_lines | 16,265 direct managed vs native cases matched in one-off audit; CLI vs FFI corpus 256/256 |
| Document whitespace-only edits | C# TryWhitespaceBoundaryDiff | doc_whitespace::compare | Exact UTF-16 boundary match, 521/521 deterministic cases plus Rust unit/FFI checks; live call parity-shadowed |
| Article/section/paragraph lineage | C# ParseLegalUnits, BuildRows etc. | Not ported | No replacement |
| Item numbering, movement, Roman hierarchy | C# ParseParts, MatchParts etc. | Not ported | No replacement |
| DOCX table cell/merge/row matching | C# structured reader and matcher | Not ported | No replacement |
| Word formatting and tracked revisions | C# NativeOfficeExporter | Not ported | No replacement |
| Excel A/B/C and change narrative | C# exporter | Not ported | No replacement |
| Rust/C# source-code AST, folder, Git | C# document engine has no matching API | Tree-sitter/FFI | Separate features, not document-engine parity |

## First narrow port: whitespace-only changes

The historical C# bug was presenting 동의없이 -> 동의 없이 as
없이 -> 없이 or skipping whitespace. The reference rule lives in
NativeComparisonEngine.TryWhitespaceBoundaryDiff and deliberately runs
before Korean morphology token-diff processing.

Rust implements this SPECIFIC rule in core-rust/src/doc_whitespace.rs.
Inputs are strict UTF-8; output ranges are UTF-16 code-unit offsets
for identical old/new context substrings, not Rust byte offsets.
It preserves C# whitespace classification, alphanumeric/underscore
context expansion, overlapping-range merging, leading/trailing
boundaries, reverse deletion, and supplementary-character location.

The FFI extension dc_compare_document_whitespace_utf8 returns Rust-owned
bounded JSON, freed with dc_free_ast_json_result. The optional export does
not change ABI v1 and old Rust DLLs remain loadable.

RUNTIME SAFETY GATE: the C# rule continues to compute authoritative
candidate spans. For eligible fragments up to 16,384 UTF-16 units,
the engine compares Rust spans to C# spans one by one. Only exact
equivalence permits using Rust's spans to build the same native document
markers. Any mismatch, missing symbol, invalid UTF-16 encoding, budget
failure, or malformed FFI result keeps the C# result. Counters
WhitespaceRustParityMatches and WhitespaceRustParityMismatches
allow regression checks. They are not user-facing claims of full migration.

Tests cover 521 deterministic input pairs, Korean/Hangul,
whitespace insert/delete, line terminators, CJK whitespace, emoji and
UTF-16 offsets; invalid UTF-16 checks fallback. The full document
regression suite is also mandatory (Word tables, paragraphs, renumbering,
exports, A/B/C).

## Go/no-go for remaining document slices

1. Extract independent normalized JSON Golden records from 2- and
   3-document C# cases: document unit ID, table/row/cell identity,
   old/new endpoints in UTF-16, action category, and displayed text.
2. Port one leaf judgment at a time: Korean word relation, part/number
   parsing, part alignment, unit lineage, and table alignment. No
   unconditional Rust replacement before exact golden parity.
3. Include DOCX table/merged-cell, split-item/moved-article,
   whitespace-only, and tracked-change fixtures on Linux and Windows.
4. Measure performance (five runs, identical inputs) before claiming Rust
   improves runtime or memory; maintain C# fallback until justified.

STATUS: one narrow document rule is ported with guarded live execution.
This is NOT a claim that the complete C# legal/Word engine has migrated
to Rust or equals any missing historical Python implementation.
